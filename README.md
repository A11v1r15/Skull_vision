# Overview:

Do you remember Super Secret Settings? Do you know that if you spectate certain mobs you'll se like they see? So what if you can do it in Survival using their heads?

# Vanilla mobs with custom vision:

* Creeper: They see green and pixelated.
* Spider and Cave Spider: They see 5 times!
* Enderman: They see with inverted colours.

# Considerations:

* This mod is Client-side only. It'll work in single player and with any server, vanilla or modded.
* Only compatible fully Vanilla gameplay mob is Creeper, but it its compatible with Vanilla Tweaks skulls.
* Maybe compatible with mobs of other mods, tell me about any other mod that add mob with custom post-processor views so I can look into compatibility with it.

# Legal:

* You're free to add this mod to your modpack and distribute it. Telling me or making me a donation it's not necessary but it'll be appreciated.
* I don't intend to port it to Forge, feel free to look my source code and do it yourself. In this case, I want to be notified.
