# Overview:

Do you remember Super Secret Settings? Do you know that if you spectate certain mobs you'll see like they see? So what if you can do it in Survival while wearing their heads? Put this mod on to see things in a whole different way!

# Vanilla mobs with custom vision:

* Creepers: They see green and pixelated.
* Spiders and Cave Spiders: They see multiple times!
* Endermen: They see with inverted colors.

# Considerations:

* This mod is Client-side only. It'll work in single player and with any server, vanilla or modded.
* Spectating on mobs using skulls, you'll see like the skulls they're wearing.
* Only compatible _vanilla gameplay_ mob is Creeper, but the mod is compatible with the [Vanilla Tweaks' More Mob Heads](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) datapack.
* Maybe it is compatible with mobs of other mods, tell me about any other mod that add mob with custom post-processor shaders so I can look into compatibility with it.
* You can add your own post-processing shaders using a resourcepack too, you only needs to put the json file with the same name as the mob in assets/minecraft/shaders/post and all necessary files of the shader.

# Legal:

* You're free to add this mod to your modpack and distribute it. Telling me or making me a donation it's not necessary but it'll be appreciated.
* I don't intend to port it to Forge, feel free to look my source code and do it yourself. In this case, I want to be notified.
